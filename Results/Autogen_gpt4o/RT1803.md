### Data Analysis Plan: 1-Year Incidence of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity after AlloHCT

#### Step 1: Data Retrieval
Ask the data retriever to retrieve the following necessary variables from the data file:
1. **Patient ID** (for internal tracking, not for analysis)
2. **Date of AlloHCT** (alloHCT_date, transplant_date)
3. **Date of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity Onset** (pulmonary_toxicity_date, non_infectious_pulmonary_toxicity_date)
4. **Status of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity** (pulmonary_toxicity_status, non_infectious_pulmonary_toxicity_status)
5. **Follow-up Date** (last_follow_up_date, follow_up_date)
6. **Censoring Information** (censor_status, event_status)

#### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. **Filter Data**: Ensure that only patients who underwent alloHCT are included.
2. **Calculate Time to Event**: Calculate the time from the date of alloHCT to the onset of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity or the last follow-up date.
3. **Censoring**: Identify patients who did not develop non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year and mark them as censored.

#### Step 3: Statistical Analysis
1. **Kaplan-Meier Method**: Use the Kaplan-Meier estimator to calculate the 1-year incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity.
   - **Event**: Development of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year.
   - **Censoring**: Patients who did not develop non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year or were lost to follow-up.

#### Step 4: Interpretation
1. **1-Year Incidence Rate**: Determine the 1-year incidence rate of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity.
2. **Confidence Intervals**: Calculate the 95% confidence intervals for the 1-year incidence rate.

#### Step 5: Reporting
1. **Summary Statistics**: Provide a summary of the number of patients, number of events, and number of censored observations.
2. **Kaplan-Meier Curve**: (Optional) Plot the Kaplan-Meier curve to visualize the incidence over time.

### Instructions for Data Retriever
Please retrieve the following variables from the data file:
1. **Patient ID**
2. **Date of AlloHCT**
3. **Date of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity Onset**
4. **Status of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity**
5. **Follow-up Date**
6. **Censoring Information**

### Instructions for Data Scientist
1. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and prepare the data as per the plan.
2. **Kaplan-Meier Analysis**: Perform the Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine the 1-year incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity.
3. **Summary Statistics**: Provide summary statistics and the 1-year incidence rate with confidence intervals.

This plan should provide a comprehensive analysis of the 1-year incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity after alloHCT.

It seems that some of the variable names might not exactly match those in the data file, causing the KeyError. To resolve this issue, you should examine the actual column names in the CSV file and compare them with the intended variable names.

However, based on the data dictionary provided, we can make the following adjustments:

1. **Date of AlloHCT** might be `tx_date` instead of `txdate`.
2. **Date of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity Onset** might be `pulm_tox_date` instead of `pulmtoxdate`.
3. **Follow-up Date** might be `followup_date` instead of `follow_up_date`.
4. **Censoring Information** might specifically refer to event status or event indicator columns.

Here's a corrected version of the code to reflect these possible changes:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwang-580/CIBMTR_data/main/data_files/RT1803.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)

# Display the column names in the data to verify correct variable names
print(data.columns)

# Select the relevant columns
selected_columns = ["pseudoid", "tx_date", "pulm_tox_date", "pulmtox", "followup_date", "event_ind", "event"]

# Display the head of the selected columns
data_head = data[selected_columns].head()
print(data_head)
```

Please try running this updated code. If the variable names still do not match, you can identify the correct column names by inspecting the output of `print(data.columns)`.

### Review of Data Head and Next Steps

The data head has been successfully displayed, and the relevant columns are as follows:

- `pseudoid`: De-identified patient ID
- `yeartx`: Date of AlloHCT
- `intxpulmtox`: Date of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity Onset
- `pulmtox`: Non-infectious pulmonary toxicity status
- `intxsurv`: Follow-up Date
- `dead`: Censoring Status

### Next Steps for Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Convert the dates from years to a more precise format if necessary.
   - Calculate the time to event (from `yeartx` to `intxpulmtox` or `intxsurv`).
   - Identify and mark censored data points.

2. **Kaplan-Meier Analysis**:
   - Use the Kaplan-Meier estimator to calculate the 1-year incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity.
   - Ensure that the event is the development of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year.
   - Censor patients who did not develop non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year or were lost to follow-up.

3. **Summary Statistics and Reporting**:
   - Provide summary statistics including the number of patients, number of events, and number of censored observations.
   - Calculate the 1-year incidence rate with 95% confidence intervals.

4. **Optional Visualization**:
   - Plot the Kaplan-Meier curve to visualize the incidence over time, ensuring the y-axis starts from 0 and the risk table is present.

Please proceed with the data cleaning and preparation steps, followed by the Kaplan-Meier analysis.

This code will:
1. Load and select the relevant columns.
2. Convert the dates from years to days for more precise calculations.
3. Calculate the time to event or censoring.
4. Identify and mark censored data points.
5. Perform the Kaplan-Meier analysis to calculate the 1-year incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity.
6. Plot the Kaplan-Meier curve.
7. Provide summary statistics including the number of patients, number of events, number of censored observations, and the 1-year incidence rate with 95% confidence intervals.

The error indicates that the exact time point `365.25` days is not present in the `confidence_interval_` DataFrame. We need to find the closest available time point to 365.25 days and use that for our confidence interval calculations.

Let's update the code to find the closest time point and use it for the confidence interval:

```python

# Calculate time to event or censoring
data['time_to_event'] = np.where(data['pulmtox'] == 1, data['intxpulmtox'] - data['yeartx'], data['intxsurv'] - data['yeartx'])

### Review of Results

The analysis has been successfully executed, and the results are as follows:

- **Number of patients**: 21,004
- **Number of events**: 1,781
- **Number of censored**: 19,223
- **1-Year Incidence Rate**: 12.71%
- **95% Confidence Interval**:
  - **Lower Bound**: 11.83%
  - **Upper Bound**: 13.65%

### Data Presentation

1. **Confidence Intervals and p-value**: The results include the 95% confidence intervals for the 1-year incidence rate, which is essential for understanding the precision of the estimate. A p-value is not necessary for this specific analysis as it focuses on incidence rates.

2. **Table Presentation**: The summary statistics are presented in a clear and concise manner. A table format is appropriate for summarizing these results.

3. **Understandability**: The results are understandable to readers without a data dictionary, as the variable names and their meanings are straightforward.

4. **Cumulative Incidence**: The cumulative incidence starts from 0, which is appropriate.

### Visualization

The Kaplan-Meier curve has been plotted, and it includes the following:
- The y-axis starts from 0.
- The plot is appropriately labeled with the title, x-axis, and y-axis labels.
- The risk table is not included in the plot. For a more comprehensive visualization, it is recommended to include the risk table using the `add_at_risk_counts` function.

### Next Steps

1. **Include Risk Table in the Plot**: Update the plot to include the risk table for a more detailed visualization.

2. **Final Review**: Ensure that all aspects of the analysis and presentation meet the requirements.

Here is the updated code to include the risk table in the Kaplan-Meier plot:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwang-580/CIBMTR_data/main/data_files/RT1803.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)

# Select the relevant columns
selected_columns = ["pseudoid", "yeartx", "intxpulmtox", "pulmtox", "intxsurv", "dead"]
data = data[selected_columns]

# Convert years to days for more precise calculation
data['yeartx'] = data['yeartx'] * 365.25
data['intxpulmtox'] = data['intxpulmtox'] * 365.25
data['intxsurv'] = data['intxsurv'] * 365.25

# Calculate time to event or censoring
data['time_to_event'] = np.where(data['pulmtox'] == 1, data['intxpulmtox'] - data['yeartx'], data['intxsurv'] - data['yeartx'])

# Censoring: 1 if event occurred, 0 if censored
data['event_occurred'] = np.where((data['pulmtox'] == 1) & (data['time_to_event'] <= 365.25), 1, 0)

# Filter data to include only those within 1 year
data = data[data['time_to_event'] <= 365.25]

# Kaplan-Meier Fitter
kmf = KaplanMeierFitter()

# Fit the data
kmf.fit(durations=data['time_to_event'], event_observed=data['event_occurred'])

# Plot the Kaplan-Meier curve with risk table
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
ax = kmf.plot_survival_function()
kmf.plot_cumulative_density(ax=ax)
plt.title('Kaplan-Meier Curve for 1-Year Incidence of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity')
plt.xlabel('Days')
plt.ylabel('Survival Probability')
plt.grid(True)
kmf.plot_cumulative_density()
plt.show()

# Summary statistics
summary_stats = {
    'Number of patients': len(data),
    'Number of events': data['event_occurred'].sum(),
    'Number of censored': len(data) - data['event_occurred'].sum(),
    '1-Year Incidence Rate': 1 - kmf.survival_function_.loc[closest_time].values[0],
    '95% CI Lower': 1 - kmf.confidence_interval_.loc[closest_time].values[1],
    '95% CI Upper': 1 - kmf.confidence_interval_.loc[closest_time].values[0]
}

print(summary_stats)
```

Please proceed with this update to include the risk table in the Kaplan-Meier plot. If the task is fully satisfied, we can then conclude the analysis.

### Data Analysis Plan: 1-Year Incidence of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity after AlloHCT

#### Step 1: Data Retrieval
Request the data retriever to extract the following necessary variables from the dataset:

1. **Patient ID** (for internal tracking, not for analysis)
2. **Date of AlloHCT** (alloHCT_date, transplant_date)
3. **Date of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity Onset** (pulmonary_toxicity_date, non_infectious_pulmonary_toxicity_date)
4. **Status of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity** (pulmonary_toxicity_status, non_infectious_pulmonary_toxicity_status)
5. **Date of Last Follow-Up** (last_followup_date, followup_date)
6. **Vital Status** (vital_status, alive_status, death_status)

#### Step 2: Data Preparation
1. **Filter Data**: Ensure that only patients who underwent alloHCT are included.
2. **Define Event**: Non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year post-alloHCT.
3. **Censoring**: Patients who did not develop non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year or were lost to follow-up within 1 year should be censored.

#### Step 3: Analysis Method
1. **Kaplan-Meier Method**: Use the Kaplan-Meier estimator to calculate the 1-year incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity.
2. **Time-to-Event Variable**: Calculate the time from the date of alloHCT to the date of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity onset or the date of last follow-up (if no event occurred within 1 year).

#### Step 4: Data Analysis Steps for the Coder
1. **Load Data**: Load the dataset from the provided URL.
2. **Extract Necessary Variables**: Extract the variables listed in Step 1.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and ensure date formats are consistent.
4. **Define Event and Censoring**:
   - Create a binary variable indicating the occurrence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year.
   - Create a time-to-event variable.
5. **Kaplan-Meier Estimation**:
   - Use the Kaplan-Meier estimator to calculate the 1-year incidence.
   - Generate a Kaplan-Meier curve (if plotting is requested).

#### Step 5: Reporting
1. **1-Year Incidence**: Report the 1-year incidence rate of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity.
2. **Kaplan-Meier Curve**: Provide the Kaplan-Meier curve if requested.

#### Step 6: Additional Considerations
- **Confounders**: If specific confounders are to be considered, request additional variables accordingly.
- **Subgroup Analysis**: If subgroup analysis is needed (e.g., based on conditioning regimen), request relevant variables.

### Request to Data Retriever
Please retrieve the following variables from the dataset available at the provided URL:
- Patient ID
- Date of AlloHCT
- Date of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity Onset
- Status of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity
- Date of Last Follow-Up
- Vital Status

Once the data is retrieved, the coder can proceed with the analysis as outlined in the plan.

The exact date variables appear to be indirectly referenced (e.g., time to event or last contact), but the actual dates were not explicitly named in the search results. You may need to refer directly to the data file to identify these fields: [RT1803.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwang-580/CIBMTR_data/main/data_files/RT1803.csv).

Please check the dataset for fields with names like "alloHCT_date," "non_infectious_pulmonary_toxicity_date," and "last_followup_date" which were presumed from naming conventions.

For these dataset inquiries, here are the more relevant details found:

  - {"Variable": "intxpulmtox", "label": "Time to pulmonary toxicity or last contact (months)", "value": "99", "type": "Continuous"} [0]
  - {"Variable": "intxsurv", "label": "Time from transplant to death/last follow-up date (months)", "value": "99", "type": "Continuous"}

### Data Analysis: 1-Year Incidence of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity after AlloHCT

Based on the retrieved data, we have the following variables:
- `pseudoid`: De-identified patient ID
- `pulmtox`: Non-infectious pulmonary toxicity status (0: No, 1: Yes, 99: Unknown)
- `dwopulmtox`: Died without pulmonary toxicity (0: No, 1: Yes, 99: Unknown)
- `intxpulmtox`: Time to pulmonary toxicity or last contact (months)
- `intxsurv`: Time from transplant to death/last follow-up date (months)

### Analysis Steps
1. **Define Event and Censoring**:
   - Event: Non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year (12 months).
   - Censoring: Patients who did not develop non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year or were lost to follow-up within 1 year.

2. **Kaplan-Meier Estimation**:
   - Use the Kaplan-Meier estimator to calculate the 1-year incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity.

### Python Code for Kaplan-Meier Estimation

### Review of Analysis

1. **User's Question Addressed**:
   - The analysis successfully determined the 1-year incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity after alloHCT, which is 8.21%.

2. **Data Presentation**:
   - **Confidence Intervals and P-Value**: Including confidence intervals for the 1-year incidence would provide a measure of the precision of the estimate. A p-value is not necessary here as we are not comparing groups.
   - **Table Presentation**: A table is not required for this simple incidence result.
   - **Understandability**: The results are understandable without a data dictionary, as the key variables and their meanings were clearly defined.
   - **Cumulative Incidence**: The cumulative incidence starts from 0, which is appropriate.

3. **Visualization**:
   - **Y-Axis**: The y-axis of the Kaplan-Meier curve starts from 0, which is correct.
   - **Legends and Labels**: The plot is appropriately labeled with the title, x-axis, and y-axis labels.
   - **Risk Table**: The risk table is not present. Including it would provide additional context for the number of patients at risk over time.
   - **Hazard Ratio and P-Value**: Not applicable here as we are not comparing groups.

### Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Include Confidence Intervals**: Add confidence intervals to the Kaplan-Meier curve to provide a measure of the precision of the survival estimates.
2. **Add Risk Table**: Include a risk table in the Kaplan-Meier plot to show the number of patients at risk at different time points.

### Next Steps
Please update the code to include confidence intervals and a risk table in the Kaplan-Meier plot. Once these improvements are made, we can consider the task fully satisfied.

If you need further assistance with the code, please let me know.

### Data Analysis Plan for Determining the 1-Year Incidence of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity after AlloHCT

#### Step 1: Data Retrieval
**Data Retriever**: Please retrieve the following variables from the data dictionary and the provided data file:
1. **Date of AlloHCT**: The date when the patient received the allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.
2. **Date of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity Diagnosis**: The date when the non-infectious pulmonary toxicity was diagnosed.
3. **Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity Indicator**: A binary variable indicating whether the patient developed non-infectious pulmonary toxicity (Yes/No).
4. **Follow-Up Date**: The date of the last follow-up or the date of death, whichever comes first.

#### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation
**Coder**:
1. **Filter Data**: Ensure that only patients who received alloHCT are included in the analysis.
2. **Calculate Follow-Up Time**: Calculate the follow-up time for each patient from the date of alloHCT to the follow-up date or the date of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity diagnosis, whichever comes first.
3. **Determine 1-Year Follow-Up**: Identify patients who have at least 1 year of follow-up data.

#### Step 3: Incidence Calculation
**Coder**:
1. **1-Year Incidence**: Calculate the incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year post-alloHCT. This can be done by dividing the number of patients who developed non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year by the total number of patients with at least 1 year of follow-up.

#### Step 4: Reporting
**Coder**:
1. **Incidence Rate**: Report the 1-year incidence rate of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity as a percentage.
2. **Confidence Interval**: Calculate and report the 95% confidence interval for the 1-year incidence rate.

#### Optional Step: Plotting (if requested by Admin)
**Coder**:
1. **Kaplan-Meier Curve**: If requested, plot a Kaplan-Meier curve to visualize the time to non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within the first year post-alloHCT.

Please proceed with the data retrieval and let me know if you need any further instructions.

Here are the retrieved variables from the data dictionary relevant to your requirements:

1. **Date of AlloHCT**:
    - Unfortunately, there is no direct variable mentioned for the exact date of AlloHCT. The closest relevant variables I found are `intxsurv` and `intxpulmtox`, which record the time from transplant to an event in months.

2. **Date of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity Diagnosis**:
    - Variable: `pulmtox`
    - Description: Non-infectious pulmonary toxicity (any of IPS, DAH, or COP)
    - Values:
        - 0: Censoring2
        - 1: Event
        - 99: Missing
    - Type: Categorical
    - Additional Variable: `intxpulmtox` (Time to pulmonary toxicity or last contact in months)
   
3. **Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity Indicator**:
    - Repeatedly listed under the variable `pulmtox`, as described above.
    
4. **Follow-Up Date** (or last follow-up or date of death):
    - Variable: `intxsurv`
    - Description: Time from transplant to death/last follow-up date (months)
    - Values: Continuous

Here is an organized dictionary format of the variables:

```json
[
    {
        "Variable": "pulmtox",
        "label": "Non-infectious pulmonary toxicity (any of IPS, DAH or COP)",
        "value": "0-99",
        "type": "Categorical"
    },
    {
        "Variable": "intxpulmtox",
        "label": "Time to pulmonary toxicity or last contact (months)",
        "value": "99",
        "type": "Continuous"
    },
    {
        "Variable": "intxsurv",
        "label": "Time from transplant to death/last follow-up date (months)",
        "value": "99",
        "type": "Continuous"
    }
]
```

To determine the 1-year incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity after alloHCT, you may use the `intxpulmtox` and `intxsurv` variables to derive the necessary dates and follow-up times for your calculations. 

Do let me know if you need any additional variables not specified in your original request or further instructions.

Data file source: [RT1803_data_dictionary.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwang-580/CIBMTR_data/main/data_files/RT1803_data_dictionary.json)               .

Next, I will write Python code to perform these steps and calculate the 1-year incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity.

# Filter data to include only patients who received alloHCT
# Assuming all patients in the dataset received alloHCT

# Calculate follow-up time in months
data['follow_up_time'] = data[['intxpulmtox', 'intxsurv']].min(axis=1)

# Determine patients with at least 1 year (12 months) of follow-up
one_year_follow_up = data[data['follow_up_time'] >= 12]

# Calculate the number of patients who developed non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year
toxicity_within_one_year = one_year_follow_up[(one_year_follow_up['pulmtox'] == 1) & (one_year_follow_up['intxpulmtox'] <= 12)]

# Calculate the 1-year incidence rate
incidence_rate = len(toxicity_within_one_year) / len(one_year_follow_up) * 100

# Print the 1-year incidence rate
print(f"1-Year Incidence Rate of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity: {incidence_rate:.2f}%")
```

This code will calculate and print the 1-year incidence rate of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity after alloHCT.

### Review of Analysis

1. **User's Question Addressed**:
   - The user's question was to determine the 1-year incidence of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity after alloHCT. The analysis has addressed this by calculating the incidence rate within 1 year.

2. **Data Presentation**:
   - **Confidence Intervals and p-value**: The results currently do not include confidence intervals. Including a 95% confidence interval would provide a better understanding of the precision of the incidence rate.
   - **Table Presentation**: A table is not necessary for this simple incidence rate, but it could be useful if more detailed results or subgroup analyses are presented in the future.
   - **Understandability**: The results are understandable without a data dictionary, as the key variables and their meanings were clearly explained.
   - **Cumulative Incidence**: The incidence rate calculation is straightforward and does not involve cumulative incidence plotting.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Include Confidence Intervals**:
   - Calculate and report the 95% confidence interval for the 1-year incidence rate.

2. **Check for Data Issues**:
   - The incidence rate is reported as 0.00%, which might be due to data issues or the actual absence of events within 1 year. Verify if this is expected or if there might be an issue with the data or the filtering logic.

3. **Optional Visualization**:
   - If requested, plot a Kaplan-Meier curve to visualize the time to non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within the first year post-alloHCT.

# Determine patients with at least 1 year (12 months) of follow-up
one_year_follow_up = data[data['follow_up_time'] >= 12]

# Calculate the number of patients who developed non-infectious pulmonary toxicity within 1 year
toxicity_within_one_year = one_year_follow_up[(one_year_follow_up['pulmtox'] == 1) & (one_year_follow_up['intxpulmtox'] <= 12)]

# Calculate the 1-year incidence rate
incidence_rate = len(toxicity_within_one_year) / len(one_year_follow_up) * 100

# Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the incidence rate
ci_low, ci_upp = proportion_confint(count=len(toxicity_within_one_year), nobs=len(one_year_follow_up), alpha=0.05, method='wilson')

# Print the 1-year incidence rate and the 95% confidence interval
print(f"1-Year Incidence Rate of Non-Infectious Pulmonary Toxicity: {incidence_rate:.2f}%")
print(f"95% Confidence Interval: ({ci_low * 100:.2f}%, {ci_upp * 100:.2f}%)")

# Verify the data
