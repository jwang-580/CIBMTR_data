# Data Mining for CIBMTR Database Using AutoGen 

This project provides an implementation of AutoGen for data mining on the CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research) published database. 
The CIBMTR database contains comprehensive datasets related to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and cellular therapy for all published articles since 2019. 
Using a 6-party conversational agents, the primary outcomes of published articles can be replicated with a zero-shot prompt. 

## Introduction

AutoGen, developed by Microsoft in collaboration with Penn State University and the University of Washington, is an innovative multi-agent AI framework designed to manage and automate complex workflows involving large language models (LLMs).
